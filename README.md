ðŸ¤ž Get values in between 2 single digits or 2 single alphabets

## Installation

```bash
npm i betwin
```

## ðŸŽµ Usage

if first value is bigger than last value, return elements in descending order.

both type and run time are tested

deeply typed

The return type is not perfect, I will improve it again when I have more time.

```ts
import betwin from 'betwin'

// digit
betwin(0, 9) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], type: Exclude<Digit, 0 | 9>[]
betwin(6, 3) // [5, 4], type: Exclude<Digit, 5 | 4>[]

// string digit
betwin('0', '9') // ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8'], type: Exclude<StringDigit, '0' | '9'>[]
betwin('6', '3') // ['5', '4'], type: Exclude<StringDigit, '6' | '3'>[]

// lower case
betwin('p', 'v') // ['q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u'], type: Exclude<LowerCaseChar, 'p' | 'w' >[]
betwin('e', 'a') // ['d', 'c', 'b'], type: Exclude<LowerCaseChar, 'e' | 'a' >[]

// upper case
betwin('P', 'V') // ['Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U'], type: Exclude<UpperCaseChar, 'P' | 'V'>[]
betwin('E', 'A') // ['D', 'C', 'B'], type: Exclude<UpperCaseChar, 'E' | 'A'>[]

// accept supertype
betwin(8 as number, 4) // [7, 6, 5, 4], type: Exclude<Digit, 8 | 4>[]
betwin('T', 'U' as string) // ['v'], type: Exclude<UpperCaseChar, 'T' | 'U' >[]
betwin('t' as string, 'u' as string) // ['v'], type: Exclude<LowerCaseChar, 't' | 'u' >[]

// same arguments trigger type error
betwin(5, 5) // [], type: Exclude<Digit, 5>[]

// out of bound data trigger type error and return undefined
betwin(11, 22) // undefined, type: number[] | undefined
betwin('11', '22') // undefined, type: string[] | undefined
betwin('PP', 'VV') // undefined, type: string[] | undefined
betwin(-4.1, 7.2) // undefined, type : number[] | undefined

// different data types trigger type error and return undefined
betwin('1', 1) // undefined, type: undefined
betwin('b', 'E') // undefined, type: undefined
betwin('abc' as string, -7) // undefined, type: undefined
betwin(99.9 as number, 'xy' as string) // undefined, type: undefined
betwin(0.45, 'U' as string) // undefined, type: undefined
```

## ðŸ”¨ Utility

in case you need some predefined types:

```ts
import { UpperCaseChar, LowerCaseChar, Digit, StringDigit } from 'betwin'
```

where

```ts
type StringDigit = '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'

type Digit = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

type LowerCaseChar =
	| 'a'
	| 'b'
	| 'c'
	| 'd'
	| 'e'
	| 'f'
	| 'g'
	| 'h'
	| 'i'
	| 'j'
	| 'k'
	| 'l'
	| 'm'
	| 'n'
	| 'o'
	| 'p'
	| 'q'
	| 'r'
	| 's'
	| 't'
	| 'u'
	| 'v'
	| 'w'
	| 'x'
	| 'y'
	| 'z'

type UpperCaseChar =
	| 'A'
	| 'B'
	| 'C'
	| 'D'
	| 'E'
	| 'F'
	| 'G'
	| 'H'
	| 'I'
	| 'J'
	| 'K'
	| 'L'
	| 'M'
	| 'N'
	| 'O'
	| 'P'
	| 'Q'
	| 'R'
	| 'S'
	| 'T'
	| 'U'
	| 'V'
	| 'W'
	| 'X'
	| 'Y'
	| 'Z'
```

# Provably fair

Seed settings

Provably Fair

How it works?

# Each round begins with generating a hash value that will be used to determine the outcome of the bet. This hash is created using the HMAC_SHA512 algorithm. The inputs to the HMAC_SHA512 function are three key fragments:

Client seed:Â A unique value generated by the client. This seed is typically a random or user-defined string (can be configured in seed settings).Nonce:Â A number that incremented with each use to ensure that the same seed produces different results each time.Server seed:Â A secret value generated by the server. This seed is hidden by default, we display only the SHA_256 of server seed. To verify the outcome, server seed can be revealed in the details of the bet, after that a new hash will be generated for subsequent bets.

The HMAC_SHA512 algorithm combines the clientSeed:nonce pair with the server seed to produce a cryptographic hash. The result is a unique string of hexadecimal characters, which serves as the foundation for determining the outcome.

Finally, we split the hash into 16 segments, each containing 8 characters. Each segment is then converted into a number in range (99, 1). If the resulting number is less than 99.5, the ball will fall to the left. If it's 9.5 or greater, the ball will fall to the right.

```
